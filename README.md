# YouTubeClone
A fully functional clone of YouTube, created as a web development project to replicate the core features of the popular video streaming platform. This project demonstrates the implementation of video uploading, streaming, user authentication, and a responsive user interface similar to YouTube. Ideal for educational purposes, this repository showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies.
